This Helm chart installs the CephCluster and has been tested with Rook 1.2.4 and Ceph ceph/ceph:v14.2.6
Helm v3 is used to install these charts

The prerequisite is to create the kubernetes namespace in which the Ceph cluster needs to be deployed
Following are the commands used to deploy cluster in kubernetes namespace rook-ceph-kp

kubectl createÂ  ns rook-ceph-kp

Clone the repo and change directory into it

The name of the helm chart is rook-ceph-helm-kp
helm install rook-ceph-helm-kp --namespace rook-ceph-kp .

helm list --namespace rook-ceph-kp
